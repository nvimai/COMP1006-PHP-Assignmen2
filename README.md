## 200385752 - Nhat Mai (Nvi) - COMP1006 - Intro to Web Programming (PHP)
This assignment requires you to insert perform CRUD operations on a database,
validate user inputs, implement security, use common elements, upload files, and
handle errors using PHP scripting.

## Application features 
In this assignment I use PHP (PDO), HTML, MYSQL, and Boostrap to:
  - Allow anyone to view the list of products in site
  - Allow users to register and log in to site
  - Allow only authenticated users to add, edit, and delete records from the
database
  - Create a common header
  - Implement file upload and display
  - Implement effective error handling
  - Document code with comments within scripts
  - Incorporate a clean, consistent design
  - Encripted the data when uploading to the database
  - Error handling:
    - 404 error page with the correct .htaccess file
    - General error page
    - Try Catch blocks on all of your code blocks that access the database. If
errors occur the user should be redirected to your General error page
